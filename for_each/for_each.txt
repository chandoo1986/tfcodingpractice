# General for_each Syntax
resource "<resource type>" "<resource name>" {
  for_each = var.instances
  // Other attributes

  tags = {
    Name = each.<value/key>
  }
}

LISTS:

# If type of variable used is list or set only each.value attribute is available.
# We can convert a list to set if it has duplicate elements. 
We can use function toset to convert a list to set and use it in for_each.

MAP/SET:
# If type of variable is map then each.key and each.value are available. 



# Whenever using for_each first import it to your resource definition for example.
# for_each = var.<variable name>
# It has only two attributes each.key and each.value access them in your configuration. 

# Exercise create vpc with for_each multiple subnets (https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-for-each) & security groups
